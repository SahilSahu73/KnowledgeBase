Date 23rd August time 0348 hours this is a test for the transcribing format, and I will be looking on how the transcription will be, and I want to check if there will be any gaps if I take a long pause. So now I'll take a pause. The pause was around five seconds, and after this pause I will be adding a few keywords as well. That will help me to identify the in context and set markers in my transcription so that I can segregate my text and chunk them accordingly. So the few markers that I'm thinking of adding is in context of context pause. I will be adding such words, and I think it should be able to split them accordingly if I add them in between and with sufficient pause around them.
