# Basic NLP Intro:

## Evaluation Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: % of observations that were correctly predicted.
2. **Precision**: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions. It answers the question "Of all the items the model labeled as +ve, 
how many were actually +ve?"
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the model's ability to find all the +ve instances. It answers the question, "Of the actual +ve's, 
how many did the model correctly identify?"
