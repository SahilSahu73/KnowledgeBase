# Design Decisions
Given a common crawl dump and 32 H100s for 2 weeks, what should you do:

## Basics:
Tokenization - converts strings and sequences into integers, BPE(Byte-Pair Encoding)
Architecture - Original Transformer
Loss functions 
Optimizer
Learning Rate

## Systems:
Kernels
Parallelism
Quantization
Activation Checkpointing
CPU offloading
Inference

## Scaling Laws:
Scaling sequence
Model complexity
Loss Metric
Parametric form

## Data
Evaluation
Curation
Transformation
Filtering
Deduplication
Mixing

## Alignment
Supervised fine-tuning
Reinforcement Learning
Preference data
Synthetic data
Verifiers
