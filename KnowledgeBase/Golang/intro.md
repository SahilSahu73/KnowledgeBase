# Why Go

As infrastructure increased and changed alot as well:
- multicore processors
- cloud infrastructure with multiple servers
- distributed computing 
- big networked computation clusters
These changes helped scale the infrastructure alot, made it dynamic as well.
However most languages could not take advantage of this properly, they were not able to 
multitask at once.

Through Go we can do multi-threading efficiently as it an in-built mechanism. Multi tasks 
can run parallely and concurrently. But this introduces challenges that needs to handled 
well like preventing conflicts.

So Go was designed:
- to run on multiple cores and built to support concurrency.
- to be cheap and easy.

Go characteristics:
- simple and readable syntax (like python)
- efficiency and safety of a lower-level, statistically typed language like C++.
- Used on the server-side or backend side of the application (range from microservices, web
applications and database services).
- fast build time, start up and run. resource efficient as requires less resources.
- compiled language. has in-built cross compilation functionality.
Note: Go does not produce a universal binary that runs everywhere.
