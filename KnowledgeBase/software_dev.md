# Upstream (Software development)
In software dev, when a software has been forked or uses a chain of libraries/dependencies, upstream refers to an issue that occurs in s/w 
related to the chain. It is the direction that is towards the original authors or maintainers of the software. It is usually used in the 
context of a version, a bug, or a patch.

Upstream development allows other distributions to benefit from it when they pick up the future release or merge recent (or all) upstream 
patches. Likewise, the original authors (maintaining upstream) can benefit from contributions that originate from custom distributions, if
their users send patches upstream.

The term also pertains to bugs; responsibility for a bug is said to lie upstream when it is not caused through the distribution's porting, 
non-upstream modification or integration efforts.

example: A patch sent upstream is offered to the original authors or maintainers of the software. If accepted - authors will include the patch
immediately or in a future release. If rejected, the person who submitted the patch will have to maintain his or her own distribution of the
author's s/w. 

# Downstream (Software development)
It refers to a direction away from the original author or maintainers of s/w that is distributed as source code, and is a qualification of a 
patch. 
For example, a patch sent downstream is offered to the developers or maintainers of a forked s/w project.
If accepted, the developers or maintainers will include the patch in their s/w fork, either immediately or in a future release.
Sometimes, "downstream" is used in context in which the developers does not have control, perhaps due to its inclusion as part other s/w or 
as part of a system.

# Rolling Release
Rolling release, also known as rolling update or continuous delivery, is a concept in software development of frequently delivering updates
to applications. This is in contrast to a standard or point release development model which uses software versions which replace the previous
version.

An example of a rolling release would be Arch Linux, where new packages and updates roll in constantly, and significant changes to the
distribution may occur at any time by the developers. This is in contrast to Ubuntu Linux, which has biannual releases, with the only major
changes after a release being security updates or significant bug fixes.
