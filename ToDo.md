The overall objective of this 'to do' list is to come up with a Problem Statement that aligns with the company's objective
The problem statements can be bottom-up or up-bottom. The problem statement should give a commercial and tactical advancement to the company
Define the problem statement from the perspective of "Can we do this or can we do this better?"

Apart from well developed and researched products and technology but as well as hand over of projects.
Ideally the timeline is 4 to 6 months.
Afte that it would be considered waste products.
We save there reseach time and solve business problems

1. - [ ] Pytorch:
        a. - [ ] torch.nn
        b. - [ ] RNN, LSTM and Transformers - With and Without Pytorch implementation

2. - [ ] LINUX:
        a. - [ ] Linux File management system and basically all file and there structure (what is where and how they work).
        b. - [ ] Linux Process Management - kernel processes (systemd), services and Processes and how they are managed internally.(IMP)
        c. - [ ] Linux Networking - TCP, UDP, curl, IPs, encryption -> verbosity of all and how they work, get fluent with them.

3. - [ ] Git Tutorials through the documentation
4. - [ ] Gitlab overview and functionalities.
5. - [ ] (optional) Fundamentals of Data Engineering - Book by Joe Reis and Matt Housley - go through the imp topics and just fast read.
6. - [ ] FastAPI - go through documentation thoroughly and how to deploy for exposing my models. 
7. - [ ] AIOps, MLOps, LLMOps - basically all ops that will be used for shipping AI models.

data lake + data warehouse = delta lake (lake house)



Kortex or suna, open-source, uses supabase

1. LLM innferencing (scaling and accelerating) - vLLM, LLM-d, Mojo
involves -k8s, ollama(benchmarked on docker)

look into open problem statements and clean it as well.
2. level up on these non-functional requirements:
- virtualization => aware on hypervisors, k8s, docker containers
- linux
- networking
- system design
