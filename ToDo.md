The overall objective of this 'to do' list is to come up with a Problem Statement that aligns with the company's objective
The problem statements can be bottom-up or up-bottom. The problem statement should give a commercial and tactical advancement to the company
Define the problem statement from the perspective of "Can we do this or can we do this better?"


1. - [ ] Pytorch:
        a. - [ ] torch.nn
        b. - [ ] RNN, LSTM and Transformers - With and Without Pytorch implementation

2. - [ ] LINUX:
        a. - [ ] Linux File management system and basically all file and there structure (what is where and how they work).
        b. - [ ] Linux Process Management - kernel processes (systemd), services and Processes and how they are managed internally.(IMP)
        c. - [ ] Linux Networking - TCP, UDP, curl, IPs, encryption -> verbosity of all and how they work, get fluent with them.

3. - [ ] Git Tutorials through the documentation
4. - [ ] Gitlab overview and functionalities.
5. - [ ] Fundamentals of Data Engineering - Book by Joe Reis and Matt Housley - go through the imp topics and just fast read everything
6. - [ ] Log analysis - have to research with yashwanth and find a way to implement it:
        a. - [ ] Read the [salesforce LogAI paper and github repo](https://github.com/salesforce/logai)
                - We should know different methods for different tasks
                - outputs we are receiving
                - how can we modify it for different types of logs -> the amount fo customizability 
        b. - [ ] Log-Correlation survey paper some new purpose from logs -> [paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996392)
        c. - [ ] LogM - log analysis for Multiple components of hadoop platform - amazing architecture - [paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9420108)
        d. - [ ] Approach to cloud execution failure diagnosis based on exception logs in openstack

7. - [ ] FastAPI - go through documentation thoroughly and how to deploy for exposing my models. 
8. - [ ] AIOps, MLOps, LLMOps - basically all ops that will be used for shipping AI models.
